## This repository contains links of my self-driven experimental machine learning projects, important articles and papers
* [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/KaziLamisa/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/tree/master) :
This is the very first starting point for any data science novice. In this notebook I used python spark modules for data preprocessing and building machine learning pipeline. 
Trained a logistic regression model with cross validation.
* [Recommender System with Amazon Review Data](https://github.com/KaziLamisa/Recommender-System-with-Amazon-review-data/tree/master) :
In this notebook I wanted to explore recommender systems based on collaborative filtering. Trainded a KNNWithMeans and a SVD model from python surprise module. Based on the best model recommended product for a given user.
* [Volcanic Eruption Time Prediction](https://github.com/KaziLamisa/Volcanic-Eruption-Prediction/tree/master): 
10 minutes of signal data was given from 10 sensors for 4000+ segments around a volcano. The task is to predict time of eruption. I trained RandomForestRegressor and LightGBM models and did some feature engineering based on feature importance values. The performance of the models was not very good. I think having some geo knowledge would help in this case.
